I am a software engineer based in Morocco with a passion for Java programming. I specialize in developing applications using the Spring Boot framework, but I'm also experienced in using JavaScript and Angular to build web applications.

Staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends is important to me, which is why I am always exploring new tools and techniques to improve my skills. When I'm not coding, I enjoy traveling and experiencing different cultures, as well as playing football (soccer) to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

With a strong passion for technology and a commitment to continuous learning, I strive to create innovative solutions that address real-world problems and make a positive impact on people's lives.
